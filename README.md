# Unmetric Measure

An AR measurement app that uses unconventional units instead of boring meters and feet. Measure everything using London buses, watermelons, giraffes, and more!

## What It Does

Unmetric Measure is an iOS AR app that uses LiDAR to measure distances in the real world, but displays them using fun, relatable objects as units of measurement. Instead of saying "3.2 meters," it might say "1/3 giraffe" or "2.5 watermelons."

### Measurement Units Available

1. **London Bus Units** (8.38m) - The classic British double decker bus
2. **American Football Fields** (109.7m) - NFL football field length  
3. **Olympic Swimming Pools** (50m) - Standard Olympic pool length
4. **Blue Whales** (30m) - The largest mammal on Earth
5. **Tennis Courts** (23.77m) - Standard tennis court length
6. **Subway Cars** (22.86m) - New York subway car length
7. **Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets** (68.4m) - Iconic jumbo jet wingspan
8. **Watermelons** (0.35m) - Perfect for smaller measurements
9. **Toyota Prius** (4.54m) - The popular hybrid car length
10. **Giraffes** (5.5m) - The tallest land mammal
11. **Standard Refrigerators** (1.8m) - Typical home refrigerator height

### Features

- **AR Measurement**: Point your device at any surface and tap to place measurement points
- **Smart Fractions**: Shows measurements as fractions (1/2, 1/3, 3/4) when less than one unit
- **Real-time Preview**: See dynamic measurement lines as you move your device
- **Multiple Units**: Choose from 11 different unconventional measurement units
- **Visual Feedback**: Bus texture overlays on measurement lines for the London Bus mode

### How to Use

1. Select your preferred measurement unit from the main menu
2. Point your device at a surface using the AR camera
3. Tap to place your first measurement point
4. Move to your second point and tap again
5. The app will display the distance in your chosen unconventional unit
6. Continue adding points to measure multiple distances
7. Long press to clear all measurements

### How to Build

Open `ExampleOfiOSLiDAR.xcodeproj` and build it.  
**iOS device with a LiDAR sensor is required for this app to work.**

### Examples

- A 2-meter table = "1/4 London bus" or "5.7 watermelons" 
- A 10-meter room = "1.8 giraffes" or "2.2 Prius cars"
- A 50-meter distance = "1 Olympic pool" or "1.7 blue whales"
